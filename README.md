## User Stories
 - When I load the page, I will see four circle outlined in color in a grid and start button
 - When I push the "Get sequence" button, the circles will flash in a sequence filling in with color
 - When I click a circle, the circle will highlight with the color
 - When my clicks match the computers sequence, I will get an alert that I've won the round
 - If click the wrong sequence of colors I will get an alert I lost the round.
 - If I reach 100 points, I win the whole game.
 - After I win I can click the "RESET" button and start over.


## MVP Checklist
- Create a 2x2 grid
- Create start button
- Allow player to be able to push start button to iniate game
- Get computer to flash random circle
- Get computer to flash random cicle and add one flash to the sequence on every round
- Allow player to click circles
- Keep track of computers sequence
- Keep track of players sequence
- Check to make sure players sequence matched computers sequence
- Alert player that they have correct sequence or incorrect sequence

## Stretch Goals
- Add additional styling to give game more character
- add more sequence rounds (10 or 15 rounds)
- keep track of how many wins the player has
- add a sound for each circle so when the sequence goes off each circle has its own sound (this will also work when player hits that circle)
- make final sounds for when player wins or loses
- add on another player
- add a timer for how long player has to guess sequence
